Blender is a versatile open-source software used for modeling, sculpting, 2D drawing, animation, and video editing. Its video editor is a basic but robust editor; tightly integrated with the other parts of the Blender ecosystem. Upon opening Blender, the [splash screen](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/interface/window_system/splash.html) gives you the possibility to create a **Video Editing** project. Choosing this option takes you immediately into the Video Editing workspace.
