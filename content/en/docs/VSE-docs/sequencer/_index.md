The Sequencer is composed of two areas (see figure 1). The header is shown in a yellow outline and the timeline with a red outline. Optional, there can be a Toolbar at the left and a Sidebar at the right; in figure 1 they are collapsed.

Although the Sidebar and Toolbar belong to the Timeline area, they are discussed in a separate subsection.
